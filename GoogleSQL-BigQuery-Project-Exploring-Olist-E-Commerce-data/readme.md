#  GoogleSQL BigQuery Project Exploring Olist E-Commerce data

## Overview

In this project, I explored the capabilities of BigQuery using GoogleSQL on the Olist E-Commerce dataset. This study was done in conjunction with the Introduction to BigQuery [course](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/introduction-to-bigquery) on Data camp 

- Studied BigQueryâ€™s architecture and structure.
- Learned how to write and optimize SQL queries.
- Gained hands-on experience with data ingestion and the various data types available in BigQuery Studio.
- Utilized advanced features such as Approximate Aggregations, Array and String Manipulation, and Logical Operations.
- I worked with DML statements to insert, update, delete, and merge data efficiently.

## Data

This dataset contains public ecommerce data from orders placed at the Olist Store in Brazil. It includes information on 100,000 orders made between 2016 and 2018 across various Brazilian marketplaces. The dataset provides a multi-dimensional view of each order, covering aspects such as order status, pricing, payment and shipping performance, customer location, product characteristics, and customer reviews.

In this study we use only a subset of this data that has been modified to fit specific needs. 

## ðŸ§  Key Skills Applied

- Google SQL (Structured Query Language)
- Database Management Systems (e.g.BigQuery, GCP)
